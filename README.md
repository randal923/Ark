# Ark

This is my biggest project to date. Ark is a digital distribution platform, still in development, for purchasing and watching movies, TV Shows, and Short Films. Ark is also going to offer social networking services. Down below you can check out how the final project is going to look like. All the designs were done by myself using Adobe Photoshop, and I have full ownership over it. Please, do not use it for your own commercial applications.
